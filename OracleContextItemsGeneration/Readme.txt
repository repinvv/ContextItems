This is a code generator assembly producing oracle context items from EF .edmx file. 
This assembly is not to be referenced in runtime.

Resulting context items will allow to do range operations - insert, update and delete on all the tables present in EF context.

T4 template OracleContextItems.tt is in this folder, just not included to show up in the project.
